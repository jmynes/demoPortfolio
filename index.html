          <p>
            This is my most recent demo, and is for the Vocalist Producer Challenge 4, an annual event in the Nerdcore and Chiptune music communities. In the VPC, pairs of vocalists and producers team up and complete challenges for cash prizes and exposure. This site was built by me out of love for the community, voluntarily.
          </p>

          <p>
            The VPC will start in a few weeks, and thus the front page has only placeholder texts (lorem ipsum) and example headers with partially related Soundcloud links to accompany them. There will be a rating system and login system implemented, and I'm currently trying to keep away from Wordpress for this particular design.

        <h3><a href="../demos/itmd362/project3/src/index.html">IIT Student Portal</a></h3> <!-- This should actually be above article, but it is inside of article for now, so that h3 is placed correctly. -->
          <p>
            My final project for ITMD362 was a group project, where we chose to redesign the school student portal. Not all of the links are active, the site is mostly supposed to be aesthetically functioning, and does not actually use real data for the most part.

        <img id="screenshot" src="img/iitloginmobile.png" alt="Mobile screenshot of redesigned IIT login" />
        <h3><a href="../demos/VPC4/index.html">IIT Login Page</a></h3> <!-- This should actually be above article, but it is inside of article for now, so that h3 is placed correctly. -->
          <p>
            I felt I should also show off the login page for the above project, as this was my first area of concentration in group participation for this particular project. I hope to later condense this section into the above section and have multiple screenshots within an image slideshow or something similar.
